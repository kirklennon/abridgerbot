AbridgerBot provides an abridged version of too-busy Twitter accounts

Many websites tweet their articles many times, making their accounts too busy to follow. AbridgerBot follows interesting accounts and retweets their links one time each.

To make it work you need a developer Twitter account that the bot can run tweet from. You then follow the bot from your personal account instead of the excessively-tweeting accounts. My own bot lives at https://twitter.com/abridgerbot.
